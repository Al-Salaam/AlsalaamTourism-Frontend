  Paragraph="Sharjah is the capital of the Sharjah emirate and the third-largest city in the United Arab Emirates. In addition to its libraries, Islamic museums, and cultural institutes, Sharjah is well-known for its Arabic and Islamic architecture.

The city is renowned as the United Arab Emiratesâ€™ center for literature and culture. The city is steeped in its Arabic and Islamic legacy, with many structures in the Umayyad and Abbasid architectural styles, and it provides a taste of the Arabic and Islamic milieu in a country that is generally mainly westernized. It is a key center for family-friendly settings and activities and has a more formal ambiance.

Sharjah provides visitors with a significantly wider look into Arabic and Islamic art, literature, and architecture than Abu Dhabi and Dubai do. Compared to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, it is a common destination for tourists seeking a culturally authentic and more local experience of Arabia and the Islamic environment."
